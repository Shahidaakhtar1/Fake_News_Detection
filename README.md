# Fake_News_Detection
The web application uses a pre-trained LSTM model for feature extraction.
The extracted features are concatenated with the input data and passed through a Dense neural network for classification.


#**Technologies Used**


Python

Flask

TensorFlow

Transformers

Pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

**Dataset**

Dataset used in this project was downloaded from kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection/input


**Difference from Existing**

As you can see in this kaggle repository they used different machine learning models for this work but in our work we used LSTM for features extraction and those features then fed to a dense neural network for detection.
